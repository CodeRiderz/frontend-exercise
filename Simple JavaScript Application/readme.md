# Overview #

Write a single page JavaScript application that allows one to search Github.com for repos by keyword.

There is no one way to complete this exercise as long as the minimum requirements are met.

## Requirements ##

1. Write your javascript code in app.js and your CSS markup in app.css
2. The results should be shown in "owner/name" format
3. When a result is clicked, show the repo's 'language', 'followers', 'url', and 'description'
4. Solution does not need to support older browsers, but should work in the latest version of Chrome
5. Feel free to use any JS library if you decide to use one

Your app (and code) should be performant and intuitive. Not a lot of effort is required for the UI but it should be reasonably pleasant to look at.
