# Overview #

Write a single page JavaScript application that allows one to search github.com for repos by keyword.

Since this is an exercise rather than a test, there is no one way to complete it (as long as the minimum requirements are met).

## Requirements ##

1. You can only edit app.js, you cannot touch index.html. jQuery is provided.
2. index.html contains a two elements: one for the search term and one for the results.
3. The results should show as a list with each item in an `owner/repoName` format.
4. When a result is clicked, display an alert with the repo's `language`, `followers`, `url` and `description`.
5. The search term should be cached so a duplicate searches do not trigger further requests. 
6. Does not need to support older browsers.
